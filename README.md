# Tikfinity-Mod-Emergency-Shutdown

I made this in python after a friend of mine had a nasty comment come in to his live stream that bypassed the tiktok chat filter and was spoken alout by TTS, it was spammed multiple times so kept on repeating itself.
it was disrespectful and disturbing of a damaging nature.

i have compiled this script into an EXE file so there is no need to install anything, all you need to do is run it! (as long as Tikfinity is also running)

if on live and the streamer cannot get to the pc for example from playing VR then a mod just needs to enter "!tfstop" into chat and tikfinity will be closed and restarted clearing the TTS on the streamers computer.

This command will only work with MODS, any other user entering it will be ignored.

this is my first time making an exe file, your computer may flag it as a virus or say that it may be harmful (i dont know how to stop that happening), just click run anyway and enjoy peace of mind knowing that your mods can help you at the drop of a hat.

Thanks
